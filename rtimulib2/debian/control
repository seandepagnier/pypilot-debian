Package: python3-rtimulib2-pypilot
Conflicts: python3-rtimulib
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, python3
Description: Versatile C++ and Python 9-dof, 10-dof and 11-dof IMU library (Python 3)
 The simplest way to connect a 9-dof, 10-dof or 11-dof IMU to an embedded Linux
 system and obtain Kalman-filtered quaternion or Euler angle pose data.
 Basically, two simple function calls (IMUInit() and IMURead()) are pretty much
 all that's needed to integrate RTIMULib.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 module.
