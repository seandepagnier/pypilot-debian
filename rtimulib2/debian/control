Section: python
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${python3:Depends}
Description: Versatile C++ and Python 9-dof, 10-dof and 11-dof IMU library (Python 3)
 The simplest way to connect a 9-dof, 10-dof or 11-dof IMU to an embedded Linux
 system and obtain Kalman-filtered quaternion or Euler angle pose data.
 Basically, two simple function calls (IMUInit() and IMURead()) are pretty much
 all that's needed to integrate RTIMULib.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 module.
